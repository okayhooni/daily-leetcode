> Topic: Trie / Design / String / Binary Search

Hint 1) Brute force is a good choice because length of the string is â‰¤ 1000.
Hint 2) Binary search the answer.
Hint 3) Use Trie data structure to store the best three matching. Traverse the Trie.

Ref) https://dev.to/seanpgallivan/solution-search-suggestions-system-90e

Despite the fact that the clues suggest a binary search and a trie,
the optimal solution to this problem needs neither.
The substrings formed by adding one letter at a time from the search word (S),
are naturally already in lexicographical order,
as are the results that we're instructed to push into our answer array (ans).

So if we sort the products array (P), we should only ever need to iterate through P,
once during the entire remaining process of the solution with a time complexity of O(N).
A single binary search would only require log(N) time, but we'd have to perform M = S.length binary searches,
so in total they would take O(M * log(N)) time, compared to the O(N) time of a simple iteration.

With constraints of 1000 on both M and N,
the binary search route would max out at a worse time complexity than iteration.
Regardless, the sort itself, which is required for both, requires O(N * log(N)) time already,
so neither option can decrease the overall time complexity required.

So in order to only require a single pass through P,
we should keep track of the current bounds for the range of matches (left, right),
then we'll iterate through the characters (c) of S.
At each iteration,
we'll first want to move left forward and right back to narrow the range of matches based on the new value of c.
